Quick reference, copy&pasted from ++$_'s post:

All requirements are transitive. Note that double-headed arrows normally
mean that you can start learning either of the two subjects before the
other, except for the single red arrow, which indicates that you should
learn them both at basically the same time (at least in my opinion).
